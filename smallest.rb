=begin 

Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer. For example:
Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345

=end

int_array = [30,15,88,2,-345,34,-1,100]
smallest_int = int_array.min
puts "The smallest integer of given array is = #{smallest_int}"
